# ðŸ§  Diabetes Prediction using SVM

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** with a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure `diabetes.csv` is in the project folder   
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the `diabetes_prediction.py` file in PyCharm
5. Run the script to see predictions and model output in the terminal

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal
This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist with the early detection of diabetes by analyzing key medical metrics. It uses an SVM model and includes a real-time prediction system built in Python.
